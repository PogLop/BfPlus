BfPlus works like normal brainfuck, except there are some more functions. So that means, it uses 10 keywords in total (there will be more in the future). Lets have a look at them.

## Basics

List of added keywords: 

```
* = multi-move -> moves pointer according to given number (negative numbers   doesnt work yet)
